# NgJobWorld
Welcome to Speed Code Academy Training project.
This project is the base project for "Angular Job Skill".


## Angular Job Skill

This skill set is dedicated for real world job competency.
The assignments here are based on real assignments in real production workplaces.

## This version : zero-project

This current version is an "ng new ..." project.
It's purpose is to be a starting point for every assignment.

## How to create an assignment branch from zero-project

(1) Each assignments has 2 branches, a "Question" and an "Solution" branch.
(2) The question branch has all the codebase needed to start the assignment.
(3) The solution branch has all the codebase for the solution.
(4) Name Question branch with this convention: CARD-Q-YYYMMDD-HHMM
    - For the solution branch use "S" instead of "Q".
    - The timestamp section of the convention is from the card creation spreadsheet.
(1) Decide the name for the assignment branches.
(2) Checkout this branch locally with the name of the assignment branch
